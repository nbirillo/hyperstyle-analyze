# Qodana evaluation

This module allows running the [Qodana](https://github.com/JetBrains/Qodana) tool on a `xlsx` or `csv` table to get code quality for all code fragments. 
The dataset must contain at least three columns: 
- `id` - is a unique solution number
- `code` - solution code
- `lang`- language in which the code is written in the `code` column. Must belong to one of the following values: `java7`, `java8`, `java9`, `java11`, `java15`, `java17`, `python3`.

- For this evaluation you need to download docker images `jetbrains/qodana` and `jetbrains/qodana-python:2022.1-eap` (with qodana tool):
```shell
docker pull jetbrains/qodana
docker pull jetbrains/qodana-python:2022.2-eap
```
As qodana for python is eap, please check [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/qodana/qodana-python.html) dockers current version.

Output file is a new `xlsx` or `csv` file with the all columns from the input file and one additional:
- `qodana_issues` - json string with full traceback of [Qodana](https://github.com/JetBrains/Qodana) code quality analysis tool.

- For example `qodana_issues` field on solution with id=2637248 looks like:

This style is less desirable because it is more verbose than opening a resource in front of a `try` block.\n* Whether the resource can be closed by any method call with the resource passed as argument.",

# Usage
Run the [evaluate.py](evaluate.py) with the arguments from command line.

### Required arguments

`solutions_file_path` â€” path to xlsx-file or csv-file with code samples to inspect.

Optional arguments:

| Argument                                             | Description                                                                                                             |
|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **&#8209;o**, **&#8209;&#8209;output**               | Path to the directory where to save evaluation results. Use parent directory of `solutions_file_path` if not specified. |
| **&#8209;td**, **&#8209;&#8209;tmp&#8209;directory** | Path to the directory where to save temporary created files results. Use default if not specified.                      |
| **&#8209;&#8209;with&#8209;custom&#8209;profile**    | Run qodana only in inspections listed in language specific profile.xml.                                                 |
